            <p>In line with increasing Government guidance around how to stay safe, we wanted to keep you up to date
                with what we are doing as a business to protect you and all of the Beauty Works team.</p>
            <h3>Social Distancing:</h3>
            <p>Everyone based at Beauty Works Head Office is working from home. Our dedicated Customer Service team are
                also working remotely, where they are still able to support you as normal with any queries via <a
                    href="https://www.facebook.com/BeautyWorksOnline/">Facebook</a>, <a
                    href="https://www.instagram.com/beauty_worksonline/">Instagram</a>, live chat, <a
                    href="{{store url=''}}contact">email</a> and telephone. Our warehouse team is operating to a 2 metre
                distancing policy at all times, enabled by reducing staff numbers across shifts, staggered start and
                finish times and staggered breaks. We have ensured there is a 2 metre space between all workstations and
                packing areas where your Beauty Works order is packed ready to be shipped. We have also actioned extra
                deep cleaning sessions across all areas of the warehouse to protect staff in between shifts. Our
                couriers are practising similar social distancing and have brought in specific measures to enable social
                distancing rules to be maintained throughout all deliveries for both you and our drivers. These include
                options to select contactless delivery or a safe place for your order to be left.</p>
            <h3>How we are looking after our team:</h3>
            <p>All colleagues that fall into the government ‘high risk’ category, and are required to self-isolate for
                12 weeks, will be working remotely during this period to protect their safety. All office based
                colleagues are working from home until government advice tells us that this can be lifted. All team
                members working in our warehouse are being encouraged to take extra breaks to maintain hand washing and
                cleanliness. Hand sanitisers have been made available throughout the warehouse and at all high touch
                point areas. Whilst our teams are predominantly working from home, we are staying connected to check in
                and keep conversations open during this time of increased isolation.</p>
            <h3>Customer Service Team</h3>
            <p>Whilst we are dispatching orders in normal working hours, we do have skeleton staff within the customer
                service team, therefore we would ask all customers to be patient and expect extended response times
                within 72 hours, rather than our usual 48 hours.</p>
            <h3>Orders & Returns</h3>
            <p>Although we are open for business as usual, we are following government guidelines, which as a result
                has reduced our workforce. Delivery times can vary depending on the service you select. Our standard
                delivery services can take up to 10 days to be delivered. Whilst we will try our best to dispatch your
                order on time, there may be delays due to skeleton staff, therefore we cannot guarantee a next day
                service during the pandemic.</p>
            <p>We will continue to follow Government guidelines as they are announced and will keep you informed of any
                changes. The safety of our customers, employees and delivery drivers is at the forefront of our
                operations. If you have any further queries, check out our <a
