<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You&nbsp;</span><strong>must</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;take care
        of our goods whilst they are in your possession. Any item to be returned must be returned in its original
        shipped condition and original undamaged packaging. Please note all hair must be returned still attached to the
        original card. If you have removed it from the card we are unable to re-sell the item as new.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You or your carrier are responsible for any returned goods until they reach our
        warehouse. Cost and risk of return will be at your expense and we strongly recommend that you get proof of
        postage or use Royal Mail's "Recorded Signed" service. You may like to opt for Royal Mail's "Special Delivery"
        service if a valuable item.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For exchanged items, you may be asked for a nominal fee as a contribution towards any
        additional postage of shipping, depending on which shipping method you require.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We try to make refunds, exchanges or replacements within one week of receipt back to
        us, though promise to make all refunds, exchanges or replacements within 14 working days from receipt of goods
        to our warehouse. Please note that we will not be held liable for any interest payment that you may incur
        because any refund was made outside of your credit/debit card timescales.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Any returned goods that we receive which are outside of this Returns Policy will be
        defined as "In Dispute". Such In Dispute items will not be refunded or exchanged. A reason for this decision
        will be provided. We are happy to re-ship such In Dispute items back to you, otherwise, they will be destroyed
        within 91 working days from their receipt back to us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are unable to replace or exchange an item until the original parcel is returned to
        Beauty Works. If you need an item in a hurry, we suggest you place a second order for the new item and send the
        original back at a later date.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A time period of 14 working days from receipt of delivery shall be defined as the
        date from when your shipment is received by yourself, being the date of signature that the package is received

<p><strong>Returns Policy - Faulty Goods</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your hair extensions appear faulty due to quality issues, the fault must be
        reported to us via email to the Customer Service Department:&nbsp;</span><a
        href="mailto:customerservice@beautyworks.co.uk"><span
            style="font-weight: 400;">customerservice@beautyworks.co.uk</span></a><span
        style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;within a maximum of&nbsp;</span><strong>30 days of the receipt
        date;</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this is due to human hair being a consumable item during
        wear.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We only recommend the use of Beauty Works Aftercare and&nbsp;</span><strong>cannot
        guarantee</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the quality of any Beauty Works extensions with other
        formulas. Aftercare products must be purchased at the time of purchasing the extensions. Any hair returned to be
        tested for alleged quality issues must be accompanied by original proof of purchase for both the extensions and
        aftercare.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All returns must have a fully completed Hair Report Form. Any goods received without
        the appropriate paperwork will not be processed until the correct paperwork is received. Failure to provide the
        completed paperwork within 91 days will result in the goods being destroyed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Any colouring, toning (including silver and purple shampooing) or tinting of
        extensions is done entirely at the customers own risk and we will not test, refund or exchange any extensions
        that have been exposed to the above. All hair extensions must be returned in the original product colour.
    </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We must receive the hair within </span><strong>7 days</strong><span
        style="font-weight: 400;"> of the complaint being made, this will then be examined and inspected by our
        dedicated Quality Control Department. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Goods are not considered faulty if their condition deteriorates due to poor hair
        management including heat damage, incorrect aftercare or poor application of extensions. If no fault is present,
        or the hair has been damaged or coloured in any way, the goods will be returned to the customer
        at&nbsp;</span><strong>your</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;cost and we will not refund or replace
        the goods. Please note that testing of faulty hair extensions can take up to 30 days.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We do not guarantee the use of our hair extensions whilst on holiday/in warmer
        climates for various reasons, including discolouration of the hair when coming into contact with swimming pool
        chlorine and the hair drying out through excess heat. We strongly advise all customers using hair extensions
        avoid both chlorine and sea water as this can damage hair and hair colour.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Synthetic products can only be heated in moderation up to 180&deg;, synthetic hair
        extensions cannot be coloured or washed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beauty Works will not be held responsible for any additional expenses due to faulty
        goods e.g. removal or re-application costs. We recommend that a qualified professional applies any professional
        hair extensions and that customers are to have a consultation before any permanent extensions are
        applied.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The goods are the responsibility of the customer until they reach Beauty Works
        warehouse. Please ensure all items are packaged properly to avoid transit damages.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Any returned goods that we receive which are outside of this Returns Policy will be
        defined as "In Dispute". Such In Dispute items will not be refunded or exchanged. A reason for this decision
        will be provided. We are happy to re-ship such In Dispute items back to you at a cost, otherwise, they will be
        destroyed within 91 working days from their receipt back to us.</span></p>
