        </div>
    </div>
    <div data-role="content">
        <p>During the summer and in hotter climates our hair is exposed to more UV light which can affect the colour of
            hair. Too much sun exposure, heat styling or pollution can cause hair to feel and look dry, damaged and
            dull. Using the correct shampoo and conditioner will protect the hair. Beauty Works After Sun Deep Cleanse
            Shampoo, is created specifically for post-sun exposure. Formulated to eliminate product build-up of sand,
            salt and sun cream from the scalp it also acts as a deep cleanse for pollution particles, dirt and excess
            oils. Follow with the Beauty Works conditioner which softens and brings back the shine to your hair

    <div data-role="content">
        <p>Banish brassy hair tones that have been exposed to sun or effected by sun creams, heat, chlorine and other
            factors by using the Beauty Works Aftersun Discoloration + Restore Shine Duo. Eliminate the build-up of
            sand, salt and sun cream by cleansing away environmental aggressors using gentle ingredients that deep
            cleanse the hair. Follow with the Beauty Works After Sun Conditioner Treatment to restore hair condition.

    <div data-role="content">
        <p>You can use Beauty Works formulas to help restore blonde tone to our extensions. Our 100% Vegan ingredients
            can be used on hair extensions. Beauty Works Anti-Yellow Shampoo or Beauty Works Brass Banish Mask can
            neutralise yellow & brassy tones to reduce the appearance of discolouration, whilst giving shine to dull
            hair. Do not leave on the hair for any more than 2/5 minutes maximum. If leaving on your hair for longer

            <h3>When should I use a Clarifying Shampoo?</h3>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div data-role="content">
        <p>Think of clarifying shampoos as shampoos to cut through product build-up and oils to leave your hair squeaky
            clean. There are lots of reasons why hair can look sad and lifeless, too much heat styling and even residue
            from normal shampoos and conditioners, all of which can cling to hair and scalp, making your freshly-washed
            hair seem heavy. Use a clarifying shampoo to cleanse hair monthly if you have normal hair, or weekly if you
            have greasy hair.

    <div data-role="content">
        <p>Yes, certain lines contain sulphates, sulphates are used in shampoo. The purpose of these sulphates is to

        <p>This will be determined by your hair type, you may want to avoid sulphates if you have dry or fine hair.
            These hair types are more fragile, and the effects of sulphate shampoo can strip out too much of the natural
            oils needed to keep your strands healthy.

        <p>
            Our factory partners source hair from regions all over the world which are renowned for women donating
            healthy, strong and long hair lengths. Hair is never chemically treated and grows to lengths up to 32”. The
            majority of human hair used in extensions comes from India and Asia. Religious believes in Hindu religion
            believe sacrificing hair is a sign of devotion. Daily pilgrimages to temples such as the Venkateswara Temple
            in Tirumala, India, where they shave/tonsure their heads in a ritual of devotion. In Asian communities’
            women donate their ponytails for a fair value, the hair is willingly donated and cut at the ponytail,
            leaving the donor with a bob length hair style. The ponytail bundles are than sorted into length and size
            and exported to our factories where the production of hair extensions starts.
