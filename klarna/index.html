                            improve your chances of being offered Pay later in 30 days by ensuring you provide your full

                            to your registered billing address. All orders are assessed individually. Just because you
                            have been accepted for Pay later in 3 interest-free instalments before does not mean it will
                            be offered for every order. In turn, if your application for Pay later in 3 interest-free
                            instalments is denied, it does not mean it will be denied for all future orders.</p>
