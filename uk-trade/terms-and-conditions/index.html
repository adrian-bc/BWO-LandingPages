<h3>WEEE</h3>

<p>The Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) Directive is now UK law. The legislation aims to make producers
    pay for the collection, treatment and recovery of waste electrical equipment. The regulations also mean that
    suppliers of equipment like high street shops and internet retailers must allow consumers to return their waste
    equipment free of charge.</p>

<p>The amount of WEEE we throw away is increasing by around 5% each year, making it the fastest growing waste stream in
    the UK.</p>

<p>Much of the UK’s WEEE ends up in landfill, where the lead and other toxins it contains can cause soil and water
    contamination. This can have a harmful effect on natural habitat, wildlife and also human health.</p>

<p>Many electrical items that we throw away can be repaired or recycled. Recycling items helps to save our natural
    finite resources and also reduces the environmental and health risks associated with sending electrical goods to
    landfill.</p>

<p>Distributors of new Electric and Electronic Equipment (EEE) have a part to play in reducing the amount of WEEE going
    into landfill sites.</p>

<p>Beauty Works is obliged under these regulations to offer our customers free take-back of their WEEE on a
    like-for-like basis when they buy a new Electrical or Electronic product from us.</p>

<p>For example, if a customer bought a new hairdryer from us we would accept their old hairdryer and prevent it going
    into a landfill site by disposing of it safely. Customers must return their WEEE item to us within 28 days of
    purchasing their new item. Under the WEEE Regulations, all new electrical goods should now be marked with the
    crossed-out wheeled bin symbol shown below.</p>

<img src="https://beautyworksonline.com/media/wysiwyg/recyclesymbol_image.jpg" style="height:100px;" alt="">

<p>Goods are marked with this symbol to show that they were produced after 13th August 2005, and should be disposed of
    separately from normal household waste so that they can be recycled.</p>
