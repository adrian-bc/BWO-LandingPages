            <h3>1. General</h3>

            <p>1.1 Unless otherwise agreed in writing, these terms and conditions of sale (’the Conditions) apply
                exclusively to each Contract for the sale of goods or services (’the Goods’) by Ecotrade Europe Limited
                (’the Company’) to a purchaser of Goods (’the Purchaser’), (together ‘the Parties’). <b>“Any additional
                    or different terms or conditions proposed by the Purchaser are expressly objected to and will not be
                    binding upon the Company unless specifically assented to in writing by the Company.</b> Any order
                for, or any statement of intent to purchase hereunder shall constitute assent to these Conditions.</p>

            <p>1.2 “Contract” means the purchase order signed by the Purchaser and accepted by the Company in writing,
                together with these Conditions. Notwithstanding that a quotation has been made by the Company no
                Contract exists between the Company and the Purchaser until the Company accepts the Purchaser’s order in
                writing.</p>

            <p>1.3 Unless otherwise specified in writing by the Company, any quotation by the Company will expire 14
                days from its date and may be modified or withdrawn by the Company prior to receipt of the Purchaser’s
                acceptance.</p>

            <h3>2. Price and Payment</h3>

            <p>2.1 a minimum payment of £500 is required to open all Trade Accounts. This £500 is then fully redeemable
                against any of our hair or products.</p>

            <p>With exception when booking onto a Beauty Works training course and paying the course in full, the £500
                will be exempt and you will automatically receive a trade account.</p>

            <p>2.2 The price of the Goods (’the Price’) is the Company’s quoted price or if no price is quoted, the
                current list price of the Goods and is exclusive of VAT, delivery, packaging, carriage and insurance,
                which shall be paid by the Purchaser in addition to the Price. The Company reserves the right to
                increase the Price at any time to reflect any increase in its costs because of any factor beyond its
                control or any changes in delivery dates, quantities or specifications requested by the Purchaser or any
                delay caused by the Purchaser’s failure to provide adequate information or instructions.</p>

            <p>2.3 The Company retains title to all Goods until paid for in full by the Purchaser.</p>

            <p>2.4 Normal payment terms are that payment must be made at the time of ordering. However, where credit
                terms are offered by the Company, clauses 2.5 – 2.7 below will apply.</p>

            <p>2.5 Subject to credit approval and unless the Parties agree otherwise, the Purchaser will pay the Price
                (whether or not the Company has formally demanded it) within 30 days of the date of the invoice, unless
                otherwise agreed in writing. Payment shall also be made if insignificant components are missing but
                usage of the delivered Goods is not rendered impossible.</p>

            <p>2.6 If the Price is not paid in full when due, then, without affecting any of the Company’s other rights
                or remedies, the Company may cancel the Contract and/or suspend performance of any delivery [any cost
                incurred by the Company in accordance with such suspension (including storage costs) shall be payable by
                the Purchaser]; charge interest at 4 % a year above Lloyds Bank PLC base rate at the time on all unpaid
                amounts; withdraw all credit facilities extended and require immediate payment of all outstanding
                invoices issued whether or not they were due for payment; and/or cancel and withdraw any trade discount
                allowed on the Price.</p>

            <p>2.7 Where the Company, at its sole discretion, takes action to recover any overdue debts, then the
                Purchaser shall be held liable for any costs incurred in connection with such recovery.</p>

            <p>2.8 All payments must be made by the Purchaser. Payments by any other party (such as client) are not
                accepted.</p>

            <h3>3. Delivery</h3>

            <p> 3.1 Delivery and dispatch dates quoted are approximate only and the Company is not liable for any delay
                in the delivery of the Goods.</p>

            <p>3.2 If the Purchaser fails to take delivery of the Goods or fails to give adequate delivery instructions
                then, without affecting any of the Company's other rights or remedies, the Company may store the Goods
                until actual delivery takes place and charge for the reasonable costs (including insurance) of storage.
                The Company may, after 30 days, sell the Goods at the best price readily obtainable and (after deducting
                reasonable storage and selling expenses) account for the excess over the Price or charge the Purchaser
                the amount of any shortfall.</p>

            <p>3.3 Any claim by the Purchaser relating to Products which is based on any defect in material or
                workmanship, a failure to correspond to the specification agreed in writing or for non or incorrect
                delivery (whether or not delivery is refused by the Purchaser) must be notified to the Company within
                three (3) working days from the date of delivery. If delivery is not refused, and the Purchaser does not
                notify the Company accordingly, the Purchaser is not entitled to reject the Goods and the Purchaser will
                be bound to pay the Price as if the Goods had been delivered in accordance with the Contract.</p>

            <p>3.4 For any items lost in transit we are unable to report an item as missing until 10 working days after
                original shipment day. Due to this rule set by our couriers, we are unable to deem an item as lost until
                this time and will not refund or replace until 10 working days from original shipment date. Please note
                that an item sent overseas is not deemed to be lost or delayed until at least 25 working days have
                passed.</p>

            <h3>4. Risk and Property</h3>
            <p>4.1 Risk of damage to or loss of the Goods passes on delivery or, if the Purchaser wrongfully fails to
                take delivery, at the time when delivery is tendered.</p>

            <p>4.2 Property in the Goods does not pass to the Purchaser until the Company has received full payment of
                the Price (plus VAT and other applicable charges) and all other sums due to the Company from the
                Purchaser. Until property in the Goods passes to the Purchaser, it will hold the Goods on the Company’s
                behalf, and will keep the Goods separate from its goods and those of third parties, properly stored,
                protected, insured, and identified as the Company’s property; and the Purchaser shall not pledge or
                charge the Goods by way of security or otherwise. Breach of any of the provisions of this Condition will
                result in all monies owing by the Purchaser to the Company (without prejudice to any other right or
                remedy) becoming immediately due and payable.</p>

            <p>4.3 The Purchaser is entitled to resell or use the Goods in the ordinary course of its business, subject
                to the following: If the Goods are resold by the Purchaser, the Purchaser hereby transfers to the
                Company his /its claims arising from the aforesaid resale in the amount of the invoice value of the
                Goods. If the Purchaser is honouring his/its payment obligations, the Purchaser shall, however, be
                authorized to collect his/its resale claim which has been assigned to the Company. Until title to the
                Goods passes to the Purchaser, the Company may require the Purchaser to return the Goods and, if the
                Purchaser fails to do so, the Company may repossess the Goods. The Purchaser hereby grants the Company
                an irrevocable right to enter, with or without vehicles, any premises for the purpose of inspecting or
                repossessing the Goods.</p>

            <p>5.1 If the Purchaser makes any voluntary arrangement with its creditors or (being an individual or firm)
                becomes bankrupt, or (being a company) becomes subject to an administration order or goes into
                liquidation (otherwise than for the purposes of amalgamation or reconstruction), or an encumbrancer
                takes possession, or a receiver is appointed of any of the property or assets of the Purchaser, or the
                Purchaser ceases or threatens to cease to carry on business or the Company reasonably apprehends that
                any of the events mentioned in this clause is about to occur (and notifies the Purchaser accordingly)
                then, without prejudice to any other right or remedy available to the Company, the Company shall be
                entitled to cancel the Contract or suspend any further deliveries without any liability on the part
                of the Company and, if the Goods have been delivered but not paid for, the Price shall become
                immediately due and payable notwithstanding any previous agreement or arrangements to the contrary.</p>

            <p>6.1 Except as set out below, the Company warrants that the Goods will correspond to their specification
                agreed in writing between the Company and the Purchaser and will be free from defects in materials and
                workmanship; and in case of delivery of services, the Company only warrants that they have been given
                with reasonable skill and care. <b>All other warranties, conditions or other terms, whether express,
                    implied, statutory or otherwise (including, but not limited to, merchantability and fitness for
                    purpose) are excluded to the fullest extent permitted by law.</b> This warranty shall not apply and
                shall terminate immediately if the fault or defects referred to herein cannot be proved to be a result
                of the Company’s failure under this Condition.</p>

            <p>6.2 Such exclusions from warranty shall include (but not limited to) failure to use, mix, treat,
                process, apply, store, install, operate, or maintain the Goods as instructed by the Company; normal wear
                and tear; use of the Goods other than for their agreed purpose; any defect in the Goods arising from a
                design, drawing or specification supplied by the Purchaser or on the Purchaser’s behalf or deficiencies
                resulting from other reasons beyond the Company’s control. No warranty claims may be made unless the
                Purchaser has paid the Price in full. Warranties shall also terminate immediately, if the Purchaser, in
                case of a defect, does not immediately take all appropriate steps to mitigate damages and notify the
                Company as stated herein. All descriptions, illustrations and data contained in any catalogues, price
                lists and/or other advertising or promotional material are intended by the Company only to present a
                general view of Goods described therein and none of such specifications, drawings, dimensions, weights,
                descriptions, illustrations, or data shall form part of the Contract, except if otherwise agreed in
                writing between the Company and the Purchaser.</p>

            <p>6.3 If any failure to meet the warranties under Condition 6.1 appears within the Warranty Period, the
                Purchaser shall promptly notify the Company. Where any valid warranty claim is made in respect of any of
                the Goods within the warranty set out in Condition 6.1, the Company can choose either to repair or
                replace the Goods (or the part in question) free of charge or grant credit to or refund to the Purchaser
                the Price of the Goods (or a proportionate part of the Price) at the Company’s absolute discretion, but
                the Company shall have no further liability. The supply of repaired or replacement Goods by the Company
                pursuant to this Condition 6.2 shall not extend the duration of the Warranty Period. The Company shall
                not be responsible for costs of the dismantling and assembly of the defected Good, and/or removal or
                replacements of systems, structures or other portions of the Purchaser’s facility or reinstallation of
                any items.</p>

            <p>6.4 The preceding sections of this Condition 6 set forth the exclusive remedies for all claims based on
                failure of or defect in the Goods provided under the Contract, whether such failure or defect arises
                before or during the Warranty Period and whether a claim, however, instituted is based on contract,
                indemnity, warranty, tort (including negligence), strict liability or otherwise.</p>

            <h3>7. Returns and Refunds</h3>

            <p>7.1 Consumer Contracts Regulations (formerly Distance Selling Regulations) DO NOT apply for Business to
                Business contracts (Trade Accounts). Business Customers are defined as Sole Traders, Partnerships,
                Limited companies etc. purchasing goods from us by Internet, Mail Order, over the Phone or by Proforma
                Invoice for use at their business.</p>

            <p>7.2 The Company will not issue refunds for Business to Business transactions unless the products are
                faulty upon delivery (whereupon the remedies set out in condition 6 will apply) In the unlikely event
                that the company despatched incorrect goods or that the purchaser believes that there is a dramatic
                difference in colour (as hair is raw material, a slight variation in colour is to be expected), the
                Company will offer an exchange on a like for like basis.</p>

            <p>7.3 All products should be returned in the original packaging, unopened in the original shipped
                condition. By removing any products from the packaging the purchaser is accepting the product is of
                satisfactory quality and fit for purpose.</p>

            <p>7.4 Goods may be returned within 28 days of delivery. Any goods returned after 28 days and up to 91 days
                is at the sole discretion of the Company and if accepted will subject to a 20% restocking fee. This
                includes credits and exchanges, additional charges including repackaging and postage may also apply. If
                we refuse to accept any products back into stock it is the responsibility of the purchaser to arrange
                collection from our Warehouse.</p>

            <p>7.5 All returns with a total value or in excess of £1000.00 must first be authorised by the Company.</p>

            <h3>8. Faulty Goods</h3>

            <p>8.1 If any of our products upon receipt appear faulty due to quality issues, the product can be returned
                to the Company for inspection. Please note all products should be returned in the original packaging and
                the hair attached to the backing card and bands intact. Any products removed from the packaging or the
                backing card will not be accepted back into stock and returned to the purchaser at their cost. By
                removing any products from the backing card, the purchaser is accepting that they have received the
                goods, they are of satisfactory quality and fit for purpose. It is therefore important that the product
                is fully checked before being applied.</p>

            <p>8.2 If a purchaser / consumer believes the goods to be faulty and is requesting for the goods to be sent
                back for testing, the fault must be reported to us within a maximum of 30 days of the receipt date. In
                the 1st instance the goods should be tested for quality by the purchaser by following the “A Guide to
                Common Concerns” document. If the purchaser then believes there is an issue with the product they must
                notify the Company that they are intending to send the products back for testing. Once received goods
                will be tested and the findings communicated to the purchaser within 30 days.</p>

            <p>8.3 The purchaser agrees that they will deal direct with any consumer complaints regarding any products
                they have either sold or applied. The contract of sale is between the purchaser and the consumer. The
                Company will deal only with the purchaser when communicating and inspecting any goods which either the
                consumer or purchaser deems to be faulty.</p>

            <p>8.4 The Company cannot guarantee the quality of any Beauty Works extensions with other formulas and
                therefore will only accept testing on products where the Beauty Works Aftercare has been used. Any hair
                returned to be tested for alleged quality issues must be accompanied by original proof of purchase for
                both the extensions and aftercare. All returns must have a fully completed Hair Report Form. Any goods
                received without the appropriate paperwork will not be processed until the correct paperwork is
                received. Failure to provide the completed paperwork within 91 days will result in the goods being
                destroyed.</p>

            <p>8.5 The Company will not reimburse for any costs incurred including but not limited to, carriage,
                removal, and application costs. Issues with incorrect application must be covered financially by the
                Purchaser.</p>

            <p>8.6 Fading of the hair will naturally occur over time and this is not deemed as a manufacturing fault.
                The Company will not accept liability of the product it is has deemed to have deteriorated due to
                general wear and tear, misuse, or neglect. The Company will not accept liability for any product not
                used for its original specification.</p>

            <p>15.1 In connection with the Contract, the Company and the Purchaser (as to information disclosed, the
                “Disclosing Party”) may each provide the other party (as to information received, the “Receiving Party”)
                with “Confidential Information”. The Purchaser shall not provide any Confidential Information to the
                Company without the Company’s prior written consent to receive it. “Confidential Information” as used in
                these Terms and Conditions shall mean all Goods pricing, all terms of the Contract, and all information
                related to the business or products of the Disclosing Party that is not known generally to the public,
                provided that the obligations of these Conditions shall not apply as to any portion of the Confidential
                Information which: (i) is or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of
                disclosure by the Receiving Party or (ii) becomes available to the Receiving Party on an
                non-confidential basis from a source other than the Disclosing Party when such source is not, in the
                best of the Receiving Party’s knowledge, subject to a confidentiality obligation to the Disclosing
                Party, or (iii)has been or is subsequently independently developed by the Receiving Party without
                reference to the Confidential Information.</p>

            <p>15.2 The Receiving Party agrees, except as otherwise required by law: (i) to use the Confidential
                Information only in connection with the Contract, and permitted use of the Goods, and (ii) to take
                reasonable measures to prevent disclosure of the Confidential Information, except to its employees to
                the extent necessary to facilitate the Contract and permitted uses in the Goods and provided that those
                employees have agreed to be bound by the provisions hereof. The Receiving Party accepts liability that
                its involved employees will abide by these provisions.</p>

            <p>15.3 If either party is requested or required (by interrogatories, subpoena, or similar legal process) to
                disclose any Confidential Information, such party agrees to provide the Disclosing Party with prompt
                notice of each such request, to the extent practicable, so that the Disclosing Party may seek an
                appropriate protective order or waive compliance by the Receiving Party with the provisions of this
                Condition 14, or both.</p>
